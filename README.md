# API-Driven Test Automation Framework

## Project Overview
The API-Driven Test Automation Framework is designed to provide flexible and scalable testing of software systems through custom-built RESTful APIs. These APIs interact with the system under test (SUT) to perform tasks such as configuration changes, data manipulation, and automated test execution. By integrating with CI/CD pipelines, this framework supports continuous testing and quality assurance, enabling early detection of defects and enhancing the overall efficiency of the testing process.

## Features
- **RESTful APIs**: Custom APIs to interact with the SUT, providing full control over testing processes.
- **Automated Test Execution**: Integrates with CI/CD pipelines to automate the execution of tests, ensuring continuous testing.
- **Scalability**: The framework can be easily scaled to accommodate growing system complexity.
- **Flexibility**: Supports a wide range of testing scenarios through dynamic API interactions.
- **Efficiency**: Enhances repeatability and reduces manual intervention in testing, saving time and resources.
